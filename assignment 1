1. Note on distributed hash tables
A distributed hash table (DHT) is a type of distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table. In a hash table, data is stored and retrieved using keys, and the keys are used to determine the location of the data in the table. A distributed hash table is similar, but the data is distributed across multiple nodes in a network rather than being stored in a single table.
Each node in a DHT is in charge of maintaining and storing a certain amount of data. A client sends a request to the network in order to retrieve or store data. Based on the key of the requested data, the request is then sent to the relevant node. After that, the node reacts to the request by storing or retrieving the data.
Distributed file systems, distributed databases, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are just a few of the many applications that use DHTs. They offer a scalable and effective means of storing and retrieving data, which makes them very helpful for large-scale distributed systems.
A distributed hash table (DHT) is a type of distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table. DHTs are used for a variety of purposes, including:
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks − DHTs are often used in P2P networks to facilitate the sharing of resources, such as files or data, between peers. DHTs allow peers to locate resources on the network and download them directly from one another.
Distributed databases − DHTs can be used to store and retrieve data in a distributed database. Because the data is distributed across multiple nodes in the network, DHTs can provide a scalable and efficient way to store and retrieve large amounts of data.
Distributed file systems − DHTs can be used to store and manage files in a distributed file system. By distributing the files across multiple nodes, DHTs can provide a scalable and fault-tolerant way to store and access large amounts of data.
Content delivery networks − DHTs can be used to store and distribute content, such as videos or images, across a network of servers. This can help to reduce the load on a single server and improve the performance of the network.
